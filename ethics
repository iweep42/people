  Simple enough.

    Thinking before you act. Show empathy and respectful.
    
    Being ethical should be homework, a reflex. Acting ethical to avoid being called weird isnt ethical.

  There is just one exception:

    People that wasnt raised in a good environment, that had been through a lot both emotionally and physically are sometimes arent capable of showing it.
    They might not even know what it means
